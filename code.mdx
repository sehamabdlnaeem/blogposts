**It’s good to make sure you have a high level understanding of the way MDX takes the code 
 blocks you write in Markdown and transforms them into HTML. Here’s how you would write an example code snippet in Markdown:**

```jsx
// here's a button in React!
<button
  onClick={() => {
    alert("Hello MDX!");
  }}
>
  test
</button>
```

## An example code snippet

```js file=src/components/button.js
// code snippet
```
